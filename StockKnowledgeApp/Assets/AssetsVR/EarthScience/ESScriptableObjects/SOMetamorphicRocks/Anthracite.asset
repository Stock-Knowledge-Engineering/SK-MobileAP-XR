  description: Is the highest rank of coal. It has been exposed to enough heat and
    pressure that most of the oxygen and hydrogen have been driven off, leaving a
    high-carbon material behind. It has a bright, lustrous appearance and breaks
    with a semi-conchoidal fracture. It is often referred to as "hard coal"; however,
    this is a layman's term and has little to do with the hardness of the rock.
